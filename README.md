#TrainBERTFrom Scratch
---------------------

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to pretrain and finetune a BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model using the
keras—nlp library and TensorFlow.

#Overview
---------

The notebook covers the following steps:
1. Loading the data from the WikiText dataset.
2. Pretraining the BERT model on the WikiText dataset.
3. Loading the SST2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) dataset from the
Hugging Face Datasets library.
4. Finetuning the pretrained BERT model on the SST2 dataset for sentiment
5. Saving the trained model locally along with the tokenizer.

#Prerequisites
--------------

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following
dependencies installed:
• keras—nlp
• TensorFlow
• Hugging Face Datasets library

#Usage
------

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the
data, pretrain the BERT model, load the SST2 dataset, finetune the model,
and save the trained model with the tokenizer.
5. Once the model is saved it can be used for inference on raw text.

#Resources
----------
• WikiText dataset
• SST2 dataset
